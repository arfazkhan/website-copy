### Collatz Conjecture Solution Guidance Note

---

#### Reasonable Solutions

A simple and clear solution for solving the Collatz Conjecture is presented below:

```python
def steps(number):
    if not isinstance(number, int) or number <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Only positive integers are allowed")
    
    step_count = 0
    
    while number != 1:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            number //= 2
        else:
            number = 3 * number + 1
        step_count += 1
    
    return step_count
```

This solution is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses basic control flow structures and handles input validation, making it a good starting point for beginners.

#### Optimized Solution

For those interested in optimizing the solution, memoization can significantly improve the efficiency by storing previously computed results.

```python
def steps(number, memo={}):
    if number <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Only positive integers are allowed")
    
    original_number = number
    count = 0

    while number != 1:
        if number in memo:
            count += memo[number]
            break
        if number & 1 == 0:
            number >>= 1
        else:
            number = 3 * number + 1
        count += 1

    memo[original_number] = count
    return count
```

This optimized version uses a dictionary to store the number of steps for each number encountered, reducing redundant calculations and speeding up the process, especially for larger numbers.

#### Common Suggestions

1. **Handling Input:**
   - Always validate input to ensure it's a positive integer.
   - Raise an appropriate exception with a clear error message if the input is invalid.

2. **Optimization Tips:**
   - **Memoization**: Store intermediate results to avoid recalculating steps for the same numbers.
   - **Bitwise Operations**: Use bitwise operators for faster calculations (e.g., `number & 1` instead of `number % 2`).

3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Memoization significantly improves efficiency, especially with larger input numbers.
   - Bitwise operations can provide a slight performance boost.

#### Talking Points

1. **Memoization Benefits:**
   - Explain how memoization helps in avoiding redundant calculations by storing previously computed results.
   - Discuss how this can lead to significant performance improvements for large inputs.

2. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - Introduce the use of bitwise operations for checking evenness and performing divisions by 2.
   - Highlight the efficiency gained from using these low-level operations.

3. **Code Readability:**
   - Emphasize the importance of clear and readable code, especially when implementing optimizations.
   - Encourage the use of meaningful variable names and comments to explain the logic.
